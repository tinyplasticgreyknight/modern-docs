- id: 0
  name: if_bool
  type:
  - a: universe 0
  - predicate: bool
  - consequent: a
  - alternative: a
  - result: a
  semantics: |
      This builtin gives typical conditional behaviour, returning ``consequent`` if the predicate was true, or ``alternative`` otherwise.

- id: 96
  name: not_bool
  type:
  - input: bool
  - result: bool
  semantics: |
    This is the basic logical-NOT operation.  It returns true if its input was false, and vice-versa.
